Running Instructions:
----------------------
In the webImageScraper.py file edit the website you wish to scrape images from
if desired, then run the file to download those images.

To post the images, generate personal keys associated with your Twitter developer
account and paste them into the empy strings in the memePoster.py file. Once that is
done, run memePoster.py file
